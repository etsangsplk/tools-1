Gopei shell install [Go](http://golang.org) compiler, [LiteIDE](https://github.com/visualfc/liteide) and configure for you the entire environment, variables, paths, ide interface and even link the machine with your Github account in a few minutes with just one command.

You don't need to use complicated commands on Mac or Linux so you just have to write go programs. 

Also, add some high level commands wich help you easy make a repository, clone, push or get a project and more.

This project is third party. For support see [golang.org](http://golang.org) and [github.com/visualfc/liteide](https://github.com/visualfc/liteide).
